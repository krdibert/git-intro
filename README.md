My notes from the intro to Git tutorial Sep 2019

## list of git commands

 - git --help: documentation
 - git clone "url from github": Create copy of remote repository
 - git add: Indicate which files to commit
 - git commit: commit added files (be sure to make comments)
	- You can do git commit -m "comment"
 - git log: show the commits that have been done
 - git status: show whether things are up to date
 - git push: this updates the github files. Note that this is a shortcut for "git push origin master"
 - if you want a file to stay off the git repository and don't want git to complain, you can create a file called .gitignore which contains the names of all files you want to ignore. Note that .gitignore needs to be committed for this to work.
 - git pull: this brings files from your origin remote (github) to your local directory.
